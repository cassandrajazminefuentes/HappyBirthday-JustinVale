    <h2>
      <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Happy Birthday Justin!!! First of all, I AM SOOO EXCITED to be spending this birthday with you because it is the first birthday of yours that we get to spend together. You are turning 15! Wow old. BUT FUN FACT IS THAT MILES MORALES WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE IN SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE. You are also way better than any other 15-year-old out there in the world! Obviously because you ARE spider-man but also because you can light up any room you go into and you are very goofy and weird, in a way that I love and I do not care if others don’t because I’ve learnt from you that a person should not always care about what anyone else thinks as long as it makes you happy and you make me very happy. Thank you for making me laugh, be confident, get smarter, be more productive, cry in a good way, and for making me very happy every day.

</p><br><p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In light of you being 1 year older than before, let’s remember some random memories we made whilst you were 14! Every time you come to my house it is always a blast because I get to see you interacting with my family which is very funny to me, especially that moment when you were boiling the seashells and my lola was telling you stuff and you both didn’t really understand anything you guys were saying and it was just so funny to watch. Another memory is when it was my first day in Australia during last summer and my mom opened my phone case which I forgot it had those photobooth pictures we took with Geo and Theresa, I was just relaxing and then randomly, I hear “CJ has a boyfriend!!!” DAWG I got so scared I was like WHAT and texted you immediately. During grade 8, when our relationship was still new, you got dared to hug me and I was literally so shy that I looked like I was not enjoying it and you hugged me so awkwardly it was so goofy, but in reality, we were planning that hug for days LMAO. Lastly, when we were still in grade 8, we kept denying all the relationship allegations our friends suspected even though we were already dating for weeks during that time. Not going to lie, it was very funny denying them but from what I heard we were doing a VERY bad job.

</p><br><p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Remembering all those memories got me to realize just how far we’ve come in our relationship which is almost 6 months. From not being comfortable with hugging to hugging whenever we want. From being awkward to having fun with every moment we have together. I really see how far we’ve come and how comfortable we are with each other. I cannot imagine spending one day without you. Every time something happens whether that’s happy, surprising, sad, fun, or just anything, in that moment I am thinking about how I can’t wait to tell you all about it. I am so grateful that I feel free to talk to you about anything. When we have a misunderstanding, I tell you what made me upset or mad then you apologize or vice versa and we fix it and try our best to prevent it from ever happening. You have had an amazing impact on my life and I am very thankful for it. I see how far you’ve come and how you have improved yourself on your own time to be better for me, others, and yourself. You always tell me “Thank you for making me the best version of myself” or something similar, but it goes both ways, and I am happy to tell you; thank you for making me the best version of myself.

</p><br><p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  cherish all the little moments we have together, like; watching big bang theory and singing the theme song together, having those video calls after school to do assignments and study, me having to run to you whenever there is a dog coming towards us, chatting with ante at school and telling her the stuff we did, cheering for each other when we achieve something good, having a “fight” over the most random things, that one time we took quizzes on what character we are from our favorite tv shows, listening to music together and dancing even though we’re terrible at it, having races at school, laughing at something we said or saw, looking at each other after realizing I left something in the classroom, panicking when something is due minutes later and we haven’t finished our work, asking each other questions about the topic, me accidentally dropping something from my desk and you being there to get it, walking to the gate together even if we’re not saying anything to each other, stealing each other’s food, and every other moment we make together.

</p><br><p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For your birthday and the years ahead, I wish you the happiest and most fun time ever. I wish you special times with your family and being together happily. I wish you the best outputs, grades, scores for school. I wish you funny moments you can enjoy with your friends. I wish you cute moments with your cat, Max. I wish you more chances to visit my house. I wish you appreciations from teachers and students. I wish you delicious foods and trips to Mang Inasal. I wish you to achieve your hopes, goals, and dreams. I wish you safety every second. I wish you a healthy body and mind at all times. I wish you to spend your moments with me. I wish you to be happy.

</p><br><p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you for everything you have done for me, I appreciate all efforts you put into us and into making me happy, especially those cute poems you make. I hope to spend the rest of my life with you and I know you do too, I know I’m just so amazing for real!!! I’m just joking but we will spend the rest of my life together and adopt those 2 cats that we’ll name Miles and Gwen, adopt that Golden Retriever, decorate our lovely home with plants, play video games together, code projects together, be successful together, and be happy together. You know I’m a big fan of manifestation so, manifest with me!!! :D

</p><br><p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Gwen says “In every other universe, Gwen Stacy falls for Spider-Man… And in every other universe, it doesn’t end well.” Well, in OUR universe, Cassandra Jazmine Fuentes falls for Justin P. Vale and in our universe, it ends well. I love you.

          because you're finally happy with cassandra. Idk where to start tbh

          but I really want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to you esp the 
          <br>
          times when I needed someone, you were really there for me. We've 
          <br>
          been through so much from our craziest times to the happiest times. 
          <br>
          We had such a strong bond that even others were somewhat curious but 
          <br>
          mostly jealous HAHAHAHA. Through your ups and downs you can
          <br>
