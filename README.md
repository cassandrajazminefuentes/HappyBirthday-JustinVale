# HappyBirthdayJustinVale

I made this website for my boyfriend's 15th birthday.
Our relationship is about to be 6 months old on December 12, 2023.
I wanted to give him a very special and thoughtful gift and since we both like to practice coding,
I decided to code him a birthday website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
